What is a "Stage?"

I think a Stage is in this case the collecting area for the content in a "mode." I think a Stage will contain "the game"

e.g. jsf will contain the world
classic will contain the original game
bossrush will contain a map that leads to different bosses



but with that being said I DONT think a Stage will distinguish itself with mechanics


data/ should have something else in it


I believe our "content" lie here:

data.entity.actors
data.entity.items
data.entity.mechanisms
data.entity.modules
data.entity.terrains

and finally

data.space.spaces
